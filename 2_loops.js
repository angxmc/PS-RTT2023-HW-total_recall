/*
Remember: USE letwhen you initialize your for loops!
This is GOOD: for(let i = 0; i < 100; i++)
This is NO GOOD: for(i = 0; i < 100; i++)

*A. The basics
1. Write a loop that will print out all the numbers from 0 to 10, inclusive
2. Write a loop that will print out all the numbers from 10 up to and including 400
3. Write a loop that will print out every third number starting with 12 and going no higher than 4000
